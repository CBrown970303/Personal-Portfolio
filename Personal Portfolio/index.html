                <p>
                    Hi! I am Cameron Brown, a 24 year old male from Scotland. After completing my degree in Physics with Astrophysics I was unsure of what career path
                    I wanted to take. After taking a year out from searching for jobs so that I could enjoy travelling and going on holidays I started to look again.
                    However, this coincided with the coronavirus pandemic hitting and looking for jobs became quite difficult. That was when I decided on computer
                    programming as I could teach myself from home.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In my free time I enjoy playing football and going to football games every single weekend. I also love going on holidays with my
                    friends as often as I can.
                </p>
